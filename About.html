PLEASE view the the full WEBSITE .In future I will style it using CSS and JAVA SCRIPT.....   Learning HTML for the first time is an exciting journey into the world of web development. As you delve into the basics of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), you quickly realize its fundamental role in crafting the structure of web pages. Starting with simple tags like <html>, <head>, and <body>, you gradually grasp the concept of nesting elements to create a hierarchical structure. The thrill of seeing your first webpage come to life, even with just a few lines of code, is a motivating milestone. Understanding the purpose of tags, attributes, and their respective functions becomes a puzzle to solve, turning the learning process into a rewarding challenge. As you progress, you begin to appreciate the elegance of HTML in providing the backbone for web content, laying the foundation for more complex coding endeavors in the expansive realm of web development.</i></h3>
